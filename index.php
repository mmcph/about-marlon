		<h1>About &nbsp Marlon</h1>
		<p>Hi, I'm Marlon McPherson. I was born in Santa Fe and grew up in Los Alamos. I graduated from UNM in 2015 with a bachelor's degree in English writing and literature and a minor in art studio.</p>
		<p>I enjoy gaming in my free time. I pretend to know how to play guitar (self-taught pleb) and really enjoy metal and rock music. I also enjoy working with my hands and am interested in carpentry (and maybe blacksmithing once I'm living in a place where I can bang an anvil all day). I'm working on becoming a web developer, but in an alternate timeline I'm a voice actor - ask me about my accents and impressions. I love comedy and am of the opinion that "it's either all OK or none of it is OK", so bear that in mind when I'm laughing at my own shitty jokes. I'm an opinionated guy, but I do try to keep it to myself if possible.</p>

		<p>Hi, I'm Marlon McPherson. I was born in Santa Fe and grew up in Los Alamos. I graduated from UNM in 2015 with a bachelor's degree in English writing and literature and a minor in art studio.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I enjoy gaming in my free time. I also enjoy working with my hands and am interested in carpentry and maybe blacksmithing once I'm living in a place where I can bang an anvil all day. I'm working on becoming a web developer, but in an alternate timeline I'm a voice actor - ask me about my accents and impressions. I can be blunt at times, but I always say what I mean, and vice-versa.</p>
		<p>Here's something I drew.</p>
